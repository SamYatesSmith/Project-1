                    Established during the COVID pandemic, where time seemed endless, "Happy Baby Belly" is a simple concept.  We prepare your babies meals based on their preferences and your available time to prepare the meals our boxed ingredients offer.
                    Our <a href="#ingredients">ingredients</a> are all locally sourced to wherever you live.  We achieve this with our wide network of suppliers, whom all benefit from our mission of ensuring our children eat wholesome, organic and tasty food. 
                    We first started HBB after performing a text on a well known pouched product which was listed as 'baby food'.  What we found worried us as the trace vitamins and minerals all our babies need to grow big and strong were in incredibly short supply.  
                    We therefore decided upon a plan of action with the solitary goal of encouraging parents to prepare their own babies food in the hope that hey both enjoyed the process and found it easier owing to our freshly prepared ingredients and simple to follow preparation instructions. 
                    We proud to say that thus far, we've succeeded.  We hope, with your help, to continue to do so.
                </p>

                <p class="para-text">
                    All our food is lovingly prepared.  Our food will always be so.  That is ou primary future pledge.  The assurance for this comes from our desire to support local producers in your area.  We essentially hope to achieve this by offering our local suppliers an alternative to the meager rates they receive from large retailers.  
                    We believe in our pledge and are therefore not driven by large profits.  We do not need to be.  We have a flat hierarchical structure and our overheads are small owing to the technology we use to procure and distribute our products. We are looking to improve what our babies all eat, not become millionaires!

                <p class="para-text">
                    As we have discussed in our <a href="#about">about</a> section at the top of the page, we source all ingredients within a set radius of your address.  Our clever software allows us to automate the customer request and furthermore, automate the delivery process after the box you purchase is packaged and shipped.  
                    This means that our carbon footprint is minimal - we wont lie and say we are "net zero" as we don't pay to offset the carbon we do produce, rather we prefer to keep this carbon output as low as it can possibly be in the hop ethat our cusomters appreciate that we are supporting local farmers and wholesalers, rather than driving our produce 
                    around the country and then pretending not to be creating carbon by simply offsetting its creation.  
                    Our boxes are seasonal so our custom are aware that they are unable to eat produce that is not grown close to their homes, therefore your offerings are relative to what is grown within a cetain radius of your home.  We ar eagainst flying produce from the other side of the world as this goes against our aforementioned goal of managing our output and supporting local wholesellers.
